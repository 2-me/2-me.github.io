Hi there,

Here is a little about me:

## Background
I got my undergraduate education at Virginia Tech attaining bachelor's degrees in computer science and economics. While a student I had the opportunity to do research with the [SyNeRGy Lab](https://synergy.cs.vt.edu/) under Dr. Feng looking into productivity of FPGAs in HPC environments. After graduating I spent a couple years with the [Montague Lab](https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/research/labs/montague.html) developing with deep neural networks to gain insights into neurotransmitter dynamics in awake human brains.

## Research Interests
How can we leverage our insights into the functionality of the human brain to create computer architectures that have more the brains desirable characteristics? Does this look like analog spiking chips? How do you create hardware that implements local learning rules? Can you make chips that are sparse enough in time to scale in 3D?

## Future Goals
Predicting the future is hard. I am currently open to many possible paths.

## Resume
