### Interests:

I am broadly interested in how we leverage our insights into the functionality of the human brain to create computer architectures that have more the brains desirable characteristics.

### Current Projects:

#### Race Logic in Image Sensing
I am currently working on applications of race logic in vision sensors. The logic here is that with digital temporal signals one can avoid costly analog to digital converters and do processing in the time domain with ver low power requirements. After the temporal processing, a reduced amount of information can be converted to a binary digital representation for further use.
